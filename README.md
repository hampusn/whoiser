WHOISER
=======

Simple service written in Node.js which makes a whois lookup on the visitor. The service was mainly written to simplify the process of an automatic checking of my VPN integrity.

The direct output without the need of a complex request through an api, makes it easy to use in combination with programs like `curl` or `wget`.
